            // STRETCHGOAL: make Server-Browser not look like Hot Garbage and give it an actual interface maybe?
            // THING ????: Add onto Library Book Review Exercise?? I'm Not sure if we have to.


            // COMPLETE (In Order of Completion):
            // Piggy Bank
            // TV

            // Conditionals Exercises (8/8 complete (from ADGP Handbook)) //Go back and tweak "Complete the Following"
            // Loops Exercises (11/11 complete (from ADGP Handbook))
            // Arrays Exercises (7/7 complete (from Canvas))
